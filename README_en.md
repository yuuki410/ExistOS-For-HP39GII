Your calculator will reboot automatically.

#### ExistOS

|System|Install|
|----|----|
|Windows|`ninja edb_flash_sys`|
|Linux|`make edb_flash_sys`|

This will install ExistOS on your calculator.

Your calculator will reboot automatically.

## Emulator

![Emulator](Image/46.png)

Download form [here](https://github.com/ExistOS-Team/ExistOS-Emulator/releases/tag/Latest).

## Basic Usage of the Firmware

### Booting for the first time

During the first boot after the installation you will see the following dialog, prompting you to format the data section of the flash as FAT16. Press `ENTER` to confirm the operation, which usually takes around 30 seconds.

![Sys1](Image/2.png)

This screen indicates a successful format. Select OK to enter the main menu.

![Sys1](Image/3.png)

This system only comes with a KhiCAS application for now. Press `←` `→` `↑` `↓` to navigate and `ENTER` to confirm.

![Sys1](Image/4.png)

The status tab currently shows the system status.

![Sys1](Image/5.png)

### Shortcuts

`ON` + `F5`: Enter the maintenance menu

`ON` + `[+]` / `[-]`: Adjust the contrast

### Accessing internal storage

Holding down the `F2` key while booting (or immediately after pressing the `ON/C` key) will bring up the following interface:

![Sys1](Image/38.png)

An 80 MB USB drive, the data section of the onboard flash, will show up on your computer. The `System` directory stores the assets, for example, fonts and pictures (Unused right now). The `xcas` directory stores KhiCAS user scripts, sessions (history) and other datas.

![Sys1](Image/39.png)

![Sys1](Image/40.png)

### Basic usage of KhiCAS

Press `↓` to select the KhiCAS app under the Application tab in the main menu, and press `ENTER` to launch it. A dialog will show up on the first launch, which is for you to choose between Xcas mode `F1` and Python mode `F6`.

![Sys1](Image/6.png)

After the configurations, the current status is shown on the status bar below. The first item is the current time, the second is the mode (Xcas or Python), the third is the filename of the current session.

Use `time(hh, mm)` to set the time.

![Sys1](Image/7.png)

Calculations can be performed after initialization.

Long press the `ON/C` key to clear the history.

Press `SHIFT` + `ON/C` to save the session and quit KhiCAS.

#### Basic calculations

General expressions can be entered in KhiCAS to perform calculations. Calculation of large integers is supported. However for floating point calculation, only single-percision floating point numbers calculation is supported.

![Sys1](Image/8.png)

For an expression entered in linear mode, select View (`F3`) to edit it in the natural textbook editor.

![Sys1](Image/9.png)

![Sys1](Image/10.png)

Press `F1` and `F2` to bring up *could-be* commonly-used commands menu.

![Sys1](Image/11.png)

![Sys1](Image/12.png)

The `cmds` menu (`F4`) lists all available commands in KhiCAS as nested entries, including algebraic, complex, polynominal, probability, plotting, etc., where you can search commands needed. After selecting the command, press `Input` to copy them to the main menu, `ex1` `ex2` to copy built-in examples or `help` to show built-in help.

![Sys1](Image/13.png)

![Sys1](Image/14.png)

#### Example 1: Plotting

Use `plot` command to plot functions. In the plot interface: Press `↑` `↓` `←` `→` to move the canvas, `+``-` to zoom, `*` to auto-zoom and fill the screen, `/` to auto-zoom and keep the scale of the axes equal.

```
  plot(expression, x)
  plot(expression, x=[start...end], xstep=step)
```

![Sys1](Image/15.png)
![Sys1](Image/16.png)

`plotpolar` command plots in polar coordinate system.

![Sys1](Image/17.png)

![Sys1](Image/18.png)

`plotfield` command draws vector fields.

![Sys1](Image/19.png)

![Sys1](Image/22.png)

![Sys1](Image/20.png)

![Sys1](Image/21.png)

#### Example 2: Indefinite integrals

![Sys1](Image/23.png)

![Sys1](Image/24.png)

![Sys1](Image/25.png)

![Sys1](Image/26.png)

#### Example 3: Definite integrals

![Sys1](Image/36.png)

![Sys1](Image/37.png)

#### Example 4: Programming to draw Feigenbaum bifurcation diagrams mapped with Logistic equations

Two input syntax modes are present in KhiCAS, namely Xcas and Python. With the ability to execute scripts, new functions can be defined via programming. Here we use Python syntax to implement the following bifurcation diagram.

![Sys1](Image/27.png)

Press `File` (F6) in the main menu and select the 6th item to open the script editor.

![Sys1](Image/28.png)

In the editor, the top left corner shows current time, syntax mode, filename and current line/total lines. `F1`~`F3` stores shortcut commands such as symbolic conditionals, loop bodies, function definitions, etc.

![Sys1](Image/29.png)

The script we are using is as follows. First we define two global vectors `r` and `p`, where the result of function `f` iteration will be stored. Then we can plot by calling KhiCAS command `point(r,p)` externally.

```python
r = []
p = []
def f():
  for u in range(0, 40):
    x = 0.132456
    for n in range(1,50):
      x1 = (u/10)*x*(1-x)
      x = x1
      if n > 25:
        r.append(u/100)
        p.append(x)
  return
```

After editing, the script can be checked and compiled using the Check syntax option in the File menu, and the result will be output to the console.

![Sys1](Image/30.png)

The following figure shows the result of compiling a script with a symbolic error, with a specific indication of the line number. (Compiling Python scripts in Xcas mode also causes error.)

![Sys1](Image/31.png)

The result of a successful compilation is shown below.

![Sys1](Image/32.png)

The function name in the script is called to execute the function written above, and the `point` command is then called to draw the scattered data to the canvas.

![Sys1](Image/33.png)

Final output:

![Sys1](Image/34.png)

## Uninstalling ExistOS and Flashing Back to the HP Firmware

You need to erase the whole flash before flashing back to the HP Firmware, otherwise you'll get stuck at the formatting progress when using the official update tool.

How to erase the whole flash:  
After flashing OSLoader or while ExistOS is running, press `ON`+`F5` to enter the maintenance menu, and then press `F2` to erase the flash. ___This operation cannot be undone.___ When the screen shows "Flash Cleared", connect the calculator to a computer and launch the official update tool under 7 / XP to flash your calculator back to the HP firmware.

## Third-party App Developing

ExistOS APP Demo Repo:

https://github.com/ExistOS-Team/ExistOS-App-demo

## Code Submission Standard

**If you want to contribute to this project, please follow the standards below**

1. Variable

    * Variables are named using lower camel case. For example, `windowHeight`
    * Function parameter naming is the same as variable.
    * Don't name using a single letter except for temporary or loop variable. 
    * It is prefered to add some meaningful prefix. For example, `p` means pointer.
    * Don't define variable and pointer at the same time on one line, such as `char *p, q;`

2. Function

    * Functions are named using underline. For example, `get_window_width`。
    * Function names should follow the Verb - object relationship.
    * It is prefered to add some meaningful prefix. For example, `is` means the type of return value is bool.
    * Short function can be defined as inline, function parameters and return values should be pointer instead of variable.
    * Avoid using recursion, consider refactoring to cycling.

3. Constant, macro and hardware-related

    * Constants and macros are named using underline to divide upper-case letters. For example, `MAX_WIDTH`。

4. Custom type

    * Custom type names are named using underline (tentative).
    * Must use typedef to define a custom type before using struct to define non-single-instance object.

5. Operator and other symbol

    * Unary operators should appress the variable, such as `c++`, `*p`.
    * Binary operators shold have spaces on both sides, such as `i == 1`, `a += 3`, except for `->`
    * Ternary are the same as binary, such as `isLeft ? 1 : 0`.
    * commas should be followed by a space.
    * Parentheses should be added appropriately where it is not easy to understand.

6. Pseudo-class

    If object-oriented is necessary, you can consider using `typedef struct` as pseudo-class.

    * Pseudo classes should be named by the upper camel case (Pascal) name.

    * For properties inside the class, its name is the same as the general variable.

    * Pseudo-class methods are not saved in pseudo-classes, but are global functions. Methods should be named using underline.

      * Normal method should be named as `ClassName_method_name`, the first parameter should always be a pointer to the instance and be named `this` (even unnecessary).

      * Static method should be named as`ClassName_static_method_name`。
      * General method named `ClassName_initializer` should be called right after an instance is defined.

7. Coding

    7.1

    ```c
    if (a == 1) {                          // There should be spaces between keywords and brackets, and spaces between brackets and curly brackets
        // code here
    }else{                                 // Use Java style
        // code here
    }
    if (b == 1) return;                    // When there is only one sentence of code in the block, you can leave a blank space without curly braces
    ```

    7.2

    ```c
    while (true)
        ;                                  // When using empty loops, you should wrap the semicolon and indent it
    ```
    7.3

    ​	(a) The loop variable of a general for loop is defined in the for loop:

    ```c
        for (int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
            // code here
        }
    ```

    ​	(b) In cases where circular variables are used externally, an initial value should also be given here:

    ```c
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < l; i++) {
                // code here
        }
        return i;
    ```

    ​	(c) Do not leave any of the three of for loops empty: ` for ( ; ; ) `, otherwise use the while loop.

    7.4 Don't use assignment where a sentence needs to be judged, such as `if (a = 1), (a = 1) ? a : 0 `.

    7.5 The goto statement should be avoided as much as possible.

    7.6 Switch should be used more than else if.In a switch statement, it is best to have a break/return statement in each case, except when multiple cases share exactly the same piece of code.Care should be taken when using switch traversal and it is best to comment on it.

For VSCode users, `clang-format` extension is available to format the code conveniently.
