## Uninstalling ExistOS and flashing back to stock system

You need to erase the whole flash before flashing back to the stock system, otherwise you'll get stuck at the formatting procedure when using the stock flashing tool.

How to erase the whole flash:  
After flashing OSLoader or while ExistOS is running, press `ON`+`F5` to enter the data clearing interface, then press `SYMB` to enter the full disk erase interface and pressing `F1` will confirm the operation. This cannot be undone. When the screen shows "Operation Finish", power cycle the calculator and launch the stock flash tool under Windows 7/XP to flash back to the stock system.
